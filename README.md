# public-notes
An experiment on keeping public notes as I work on or research something.

I've earlier written about [learning in public](https://hamatti.org/posts/learning-in-public/) and recently I've wanted to explore more about _building in public_.

Let's see where this journey leads. These notes live in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Hamatti/public-notes/issues).
